# Jose's ZSH Theme
A simple theme for *oh-my-zsh*

## Installation

Easy install (tested on macOS only)
```
$ cd path/to/folder
```
```
$ sh install.sh
```

You can also manually install it by moving the `shrug.zsh-theme` file to `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/`, and then set the value of the `ZSH_THEME` value to `shrug` in the `~/.zshrc` file here.

```
# Set name of the theme to load. Optionally, if you set this to "random"
# it'll load a random theme each time that oh-my-zsh is loaded.
# See https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Themes
ZSH_THEME="shrug"
```
